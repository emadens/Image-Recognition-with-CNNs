# Image-Recognition-with-CNNs

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course! You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course. We set up a competition to make things more fun! ðŸ˜Ž

In this homework you are required to classify images of leafs (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

Given the objective of the challenge we managed to solve the competition through the ensemble of two models trained and tuned for our specific problem.
- Xception model
- Inception model

To dive deeper on how we got to this solution you can find the [report](report.pdf)
